# Gatsby
A repo were will contain some studies, examples and slides about my Gatsby talk :D

## Useful things to tell in the talk
- Gatsby has some starters boilerplates, which can be found here https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/
They're nice to learn how things work. There some official and unofficial Gatsby boilerplates, and community can pr their own :D
